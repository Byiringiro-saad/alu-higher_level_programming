This is the "tests/test_models/test_base.py" file for testing the Base class.

The Base class manages the 'id' attribute and provides a mechanism for
generating unique ids for instances.

Tests will cover:
- Initialization with and without 'id'.
- Handling of the 'id' attribute and automatic id generation.
